### Auto Scrapper (Legion Remix)

The addon includes an auto-scrapping system that appears when you open a scrapping machine:

- **Automatic Scrapping**: Automatically fills the scrapping machine with items matching your filters
- **Quality Filtering**: Set maximum item quality to scrap (Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Epic)
- **Item Level Filtering**: Only scrap items below your currently equipped gear by a specified item level difference
- **Affix Blacklist**: Exclude items with specific stats or affixes from being scrapped
  - Preset list of Legion Remix affixes (with spell icons and tooltips)
  - Common stats dropdown (Avoidance, Critical Strike, Haste, Leech, Mastery, Speed, Versatility)
  - Custom text entry for other affixes or stats
- **Item Preview**: Side panel shows all items matching your filters
- **Scrapping Queue**: Bottom panel displays items currently loaded in the scrapping machine
- **Settings**: Configure all options either in-game through the scrapping UI or via `/rpl` command

The auto scrapper helps manage large amounts of gear during Legion Remix by automating the tedious process of manually selecting items to scrap.
