**Lib's - Remix Power Level** Displays the power level of your character on the character screen and in tooltips when mousing over other players. Supports both MOP Remix (cloak threads) and Legion Remix (Infinite Power buff).

## Features

- **MOP Remix**: Displays the thread count of your cloak on the character screen.
- **Legion Remix**: Displays the Infinite Power buff count on the character screen.
- Adds power level information to tooltips when you mouse over other players.
- Seamlessly integrates with your UI.

**Note for Legion Remix**: Due to the changes in how power is done in Legion (now being a currency instead of threads), we cannot show the full extent of a character's level but we can at least approximate it based off the buff given. We will make updates to this addon as remix progresses if a better way is found.
