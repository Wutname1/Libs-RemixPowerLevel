Displays power level information for Timerunner characters in both MOP Remix and Legion Remix. Track your thread count or Infinite Power buff and see other players' progression.

## Features

### Power Level Display

- **Character Screen**: View your power level directly on the character sheet
  - **MOP Remix**: Thread count displayed next to the Cloak of Infinite Potential
  - **Legion Remix**: Infinite Power shown above the main weapon slot
- **Tooltips**: Mouse over other players to see their power levels
- **Minimap Button**: Shows top 10 power levels in your current group or raid

### Auto Scrapper (Legion Remix)

The addon includes an auto-scrapping system that appears when you open a scrapping machine:

- **Automatic Scrapping**: Automatically fills the scrapping machine with items matching your filters
- **Quality Filtering**: Set maximum item quality to scrap (Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Epic)
- **Item Level Filtering**: Only scrap items below your currently equipped gear by a specified item level difference
- **Affix Blacklist**: Exclude items with specific stats or affixes from being scrapped
  - Preset list of Legion Remix affixes (with spell icons and tooltips)
  - Common stats dropdown (Avoidance, Critical Strike, Haste, Leech, Mastery, Speed, Versatility)
  - Custom text entry for other affixes or stats
- **Item Preview**: Side panel shows all items matching your filters
- **Scrapping Queue**: Bottom panel displays items currently loaded in the scrapping machine
- **Settings**: Configure all options either in-game through the scrapping UI or via `/rpl` command

The auto scrapper helps manage large amounts of gear during Legion Remix by automating the tedious process of manually selecting items to scrap.

## Commands

- `/rpl` or `/remixpowerlevel` - Opens the addon settings

## Display Options

All display features can be toggled on or off in the addon settings:

## Technical Note

Legion Remix tracks power as a currency rather than threads like MOP Remix. The addon displays the Infinite Power buff count as an indicator of total power level.
